{"name":"C9-setup","tagline":"Your one-click Checkbox c9.io workspace ","body":"c9.io setup script for checkbox\r\n===============================\r\n\r\nWith this script, anyone can get a working checkbox development environment for\r\nfree, in minutes, on any OS. All you have to do is:\r\n\r\nGet a c9.io account\r\n===================\r\n\r\nGo to https://c9.io and sign in with your github or bitbucket accounts.\r\n\r\nGet a launchpad.net account\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nYou'll need a launchpad to push your checkbox banches back to launchped.\r\nGo to https://login.launchpad.net/+login to create an account if needed.\r\n\r\nIf you've never used c9.io with launchpad before, make sure to add your c9.io\r\nssh key to your launchpad account. Unfortunately there are no simple links for\r\nthat (ah, all those shiny 2.0 webapps). On c9.io go to your dashboard and click\r\non \"Show your SSH key\" on the right. Copy that key. On launchpad.net click on\r\nyour username in the top-right corner, click on the yellow circle/pencil icon\r\nnext to the \"SSH keys\" section. Paste in your key and save, you should be good\r\nto go. \r\n\r\nCreate a new workspace\r\n======================\r\n\r\nGo to your c9.io dashboard and create a new workspace, any name will do but you\r\ncan use `checkbox` to know what it is for later on. Make sure to select the\r\n*custom* workspace type then click on \"create\"\r\n\r\nAfter the workspace is created click on the \"start editing\" button. This will\r\nopen a new tab/window specific for that workspace. In the new tab look at the\r\ndefault window layout. You should have a terminal running at the bottom of the\r\npage. You can open additional terminals with `alt+t`.\r\n\r\nPaste the following code:\r\n```\r\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkbox/c9-setup/master/c9-setup.sh | sh\r\n```\r\nVolia :-) You should be good to go now.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
